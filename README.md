# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to **predict the quality of wine** based on various physicochemical properties using multiple Machine Learning models. The dataset used is a freely available **Wine Quality Dataset**, which contains important features influencing the quality of red or white wine.

## 📌 Objective

To build and compare multiple machine learning models to accurately predict wine quality based on its features such as acidity, alcohol, pH, and other chemical properties.
